KURTOID(6)                   Games Manual                   KURTOID(6)

NAME
       Kurtoid  ‒  Bot  for the swiss card game «Jassen» developed for
       the lecture «Deep Learning For Games»

DESCRIPTION
       TODO: Kurtoid is a simple bot. There are multiple bots, we  use
       trumpruloid.py...

TRUMP SELECTION
       The  trump  selection  is implemented using a simple heuristic-
       based algorithm using a concept called Bockchain.  A card  that
       is  unbeatable for color trumps resp. unbeatable when played as
       the first card in  «Obe-Abe»  or  «Unde-Ufe»  game,  is  called
       «Bock»  in Swiss German. The idea behind the Bockchain is to go
       through all six possible trump selections, and compute how many
       «Böck»  are  in  the  hand for each of those. For each possible
       trump, a score is calculated, which is computed by  the  number
       of  cards  for  each  trump  color,  plus  the  length  of  the
       Bockchain.  The trump option with  the  highest  score  is  se‐
       lected. If the player can select the trump forehand, and if the
       total score is below a threshold of five, the  trump  selection
       is pushed to the partner.

CARD SELECTION
       TODO:  simulate  round  for every card, pick card one, simulate
       the other cards randomly, pick card with the best outcome

DEPLOYMENT
       The application is packed into a  Docker  container,  which  is
       pushed  to Heroku. The credentials to the Enterprise Lab GitLab
       are to be injected using environment variables into the  Docker
       build  process, in order to pull the DL4G Jass library, without
       exposing it to the internet.
