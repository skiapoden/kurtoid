NAME
       Kurtoid a Bot for the swiss card game ``Jassen'' developed for the lec-
       ture A<<Deep Learning For GamesA>>

DESCRIPTION
       TODO: Kurtoid is a simple bot. There are multiple bots, we use trumpru-
       loid.py...

TRUMP SELECTION
       The trump selection is implemented using a simple heuristic-based algo-
       rithm using a concept called Bockchain.  A card that is unbeatable  for
       color  trumps  resp. unbeatable when played as the first card in ``Obe-
       Abe'' or ``Unde-Ufe'' game, is called ``Bock''  in  Swiss  German.  The
       idea  behind  the  Bockchain  is  to  go through all six possible trump
       selections, and compute how many ``Boeck'' are in the hand for each  of
       those.  For  each  possible trump, a score is calculated, which is com-
       puted by the number of cards for each trump color, plus the  length  of
       the Bockchain.  The trump option with the highest score is selected. If
       the player can select the trump forehand, and if  the  total  score  is
       below  a  threshold of five, the trump selection is pushed to the part-
       ner. (The number of five was calculated by simulating the card  distri-
       bution many times. On average, players got a score a bit below 5 as the
       best trump option.)

CARD SELECTION
       The card selection is done by first determining  all  valid  (playable)
       cards.  If  there  is  more  than one, a simulation is started for each
       valid card, where the opponents are randomly assigned a card  from  the
       remaining  unplayed cards. The points for each simulated round are cal-
       culated and the card yielding the best outcome is then played.

DEPLOYMENT
       The application is packed into a Docker container, which is  pushed  to
       Heroku. The credentials to the Enterprise Lab GitLab are to be injected
       using environment variables into the Docker build process, in order  to
       pull the DL4G Jass library, without exposing it to the internet.
